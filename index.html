				<h3>Description</h3>
					<p> Jolly Jim’s Kitchen is a single player 2D arena shooter. As the player you will control Jolly Jim’s ever loyal friend, the Spork. Jolly Jim has taken a leave of absence unexpectedly to the East Indies and it is up to you to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The immediate problem is Jolly Jim’s world famous chili; all the ingredients are rebelling and trying to take over as the central flavor of the dish. In the games single level, the bowl of chili, different ingredients will form together and try to take out the Spork. The Spork’s arsenal will include shooting rice bullets, and sucking in the destroyed remnants of enemies and then reflecting them back as an additional weapon. </p>

			<h2>Info</h2>
				<p> My name is Jordan Buehler. I am in my final year at Herzing University in the Game Development program. </p>
			
				<p> Looking toward the future, I hope to have a position within a company doing what I love, designing games, collaborating with my peers, solving problems, and creating meaningful pieces of work. </p>
			
				<p> This is a collection of my design, game development, and other projects. Combined these help showcase my abilities. </p>

				<p> In addition to my work while attending school I helped coordinate the Wisconsin Game Developers Summit 2013 alongside Travis Garski and Ben Mathwig. The event was a two day game development conference held at the UW-Milwaukee Student Union in April. We created the event to be a gathering point for Students, hobbyists, and professions from around the midwest to come together to network and discuss the multitude of topics that span across game development. There were over 250 attendees and we recieved very postiive feedback that we are already using as a guide for next year.
